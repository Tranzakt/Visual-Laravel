# So you are interested in contributingâ€¦

This project is free for people to use,
and there is no formal obligation for users to contribute back to this project,
but we would like to think that people will be willing to help improve it
in return for the benefits that they get from using it.
So, thank you for even considering contributing to this project.

## Types of Contribution

There are many ways that you can potentially contribute to this project,
a lot of which do not require you to be an experienced PHP or Javascript programmer.

* Helping other, less experienced community members is an easy way to give something back,
particularly when you have not been using this software very long.
* Another great way to give something back is to use your own experiences
in using our documentation, and the shortcomings you found,
to improve the documentation for others.
* We want our documentation to be accessible to people whose first language is not English,
ideally by having translations of **all** the strings we use
into all the languages spoken.
We intend to implement an automated AI-driven approach
to providing an initial translation of new strings,
but these sorts of tools can and will make awful mistakes
which need to be corrected by humans
who speak the language colloquially.
* Coding - if you have the skills (or are willing to learn them)
there will always be opportunities for making code contributions,
fixing bugs you have found in your own usage,
filling in gaps in the functionality that you found
(either in core Laravel functionality or the wider ecosystem)
or even extending the project in an entirely new direction.
* If you don't have the time or the skills for any of the above,
but would like to make a financial donation,
that would be very welcome in order to defray essential costs for
e.g. SSL certificates, hosting infrastructure and services,
cloud services such as AI, etc.

Whatever route you use, we will be grateful for any help you choose to give us.

If you are not sure what our priorities are,
please contact us to find out what we would ideally like you to work on.

## Copyright & Attribution

When making a contribution of either code or documentation,
you will be doing so on the explicit formal understanding that:

* You (or the team if the contribution is a joint effort) have either
created the intellectual property yourself through your own efforts in your own time; or
* You have created the IP yourself through your own efforts whilst employed,
and your employer has given you explicit written authority to
contribute the IP back to the project; or
* The IP was sourced from another open source project whose license
allows for code to be used in a different project.

We believe that these options will cover the vast majority of contributions,
however if you are uncertain about whether your contributions meet these criteria,
please contact the project's leadership team for clarification.
