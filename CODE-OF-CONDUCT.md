# Tranzakt Project's Code of Conduct

## TL;DR Summary

**TL;DR TL;DR:** Wheaton's Law: "Don't be a dick!"

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are
free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others,
participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

## Culture

The Transakt Projects wishes to foster an open and welcoming environment for contributors,
and accordingly we require all contributors to commit to the following code-of-conduct in order to make contributing to our project a happy and pleasant experience, free of harassment and discrimination against any person for any reason.

To avoid any doubt, this Code of Conduct applies without exception to all contributors, from the senior coders to a community newcomer looking to make their first contribution e.g. a translation.

Again, to avoid any doubt, harassment and / or discrimination includes (but is not limited to) personal attacks or criticism based on age, race, colour, ancestry, national origin, religion creed, roles in the armed services, sex / sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, medical conditions, physical or mental disability, gender identity, or political position etc.

Discriminatory conduct and harassment violates the dignity of individuals,
and impacts our ability to achieve our goal to deliver a complicated and complex project,
and consequently will not be tolerated.
Put simply, our view is that no one person, however senior,
is considered indispensable to this project -
maintaining a pleasant and productive culture is, in our opinion,
more important.  

That said, harassment and discrimination are personal attacks of any form,
and these are **NOT** the same as differences of opinion relating to
subjects relevant to this project, and debated rationally.
***The freedom to hold relevant differing opinions and to express them is as essential a freedom as the freedom to be free from harassment and discrimination.***

## Our standards

You are expected to meet this goal by adopting the following approach:

* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences -
and equally, be confident about expressing your own viewpoint
even if it differs from others'.
* Listen to, and consider, constructive criticism, designed to help you to deliver better contributions -
and equally feel free to explain to others how you believe they could improve still further their contributions.
* Similarly, be generous with praise for other people's efforts,
and see what is in the 1/2 full glass before focusing on the empty half.
* Act in the best, long-term interests of the community
* Show empathy to others

Behaviors our community will not tolerate:

* Harassment - public or private
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling - derogatory interactions and personal or political attacks
* Doxing - publishing others' private information without permission
* Plagiarism - synergistic and legal use of other open source intellectual property is welcomed,
but please give credit where it is due.
* Any conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in professional settings

## Our responsibilities

Whilst all contributors have the responsibility of following
this Code-of-Conduct,
the additional responsibility of judging and enforcing it
falls upon the project leadership team,
whose decisions will be final and non-appealable.

In the end, no written definition is going to cover all possible nuances,
and a common-sense, man-on-the-omnibus, sympathetic/empathetic view
will be taken by the project leadership to determine whether behaviour
is contrary to this Code of Conduct.

Whilst the leadership team is **not** in favour of any form of censorship,
in the interests of the overall long-term success of this project,
we reserve the right to remove or modify comments, commits, code, documentation,
issues, and any other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in spaces
where an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include (but are not limited to):

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an official representative at an event
* Any situation where a 3rd party might reasonably assume or believe
that you are representing the project in any official
or semi-official capacity.

## Enforcement

We would idealistically like to believe that enforcement will never be needed,
however our own prior experiences on other projects unfortunately
suggests otherwise.

If you have been the target of behaviour which violates this Code-of-Conduct,
or have been witness to it,
please report it to the project leadership by email or direct message.

Such reports are made in confidence,
and the project leadership is obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.

The project leadership will review and investigate all complaints,
recognising that viewpoints and memories of the incident may differ.
If appropriate, reconciliation will generally be a first objective,
and warnings and timeouts will normally be considered for
first offences,
however the project leadership reserves the right to respond in any way that it deems appropriate,
including (but not limited to) private or public warnings, a required private or public apology,
a temporary or permanent ban on private or direct communication with other specific individuals,
a temporary or permanent ban on all involvement with the project etc.

## CoC attribution

This Code-of-Conduct is loosely based on a combination of
[Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/dontbeadick.html),
the [Ruby Code-of-Conduct](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/)
(adopted by the Laravel team),
and the [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4).
